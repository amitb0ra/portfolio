# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my projects, skills, and ways to get in touch with me.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/amitb0ra/portfolio.git portfolio
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Open the project with Live Server:**

   If you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code, right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".

Your portfolio website should now be running on `http://localhost:5500`.
